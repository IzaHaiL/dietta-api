# Welcome 



The API Dietta is an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides access to various features and data within the Dietta application. This API is designed to allow developers or third parties to connect to Dietta and integrate its health features into their own applications.

Here is a description of the main features that can be accessed through the API Dietta:

1.  User Feature: The Dietta API provides the ability to manage user information, such as user profiles, personal preferences, and health data. Developers can use this API to create, update, or delete user profiles, as well as access relevant user data.
    
2.  Video Feature: The Dietta API grants access to the video library provided by the Dietta application. Developers can use this API to display exercise videos, tutorials, or health guides within their own applications, allowing users to easily access valuable visual content.
    
3.  History Feature: Through the Dietta API, developers can access user historical data, such as exercise history, previous meal patterns, or other health records. This allows developers to display information about user progress or provide useful analytical features to track changes and health achievements.
    
4.  Schedule Feature: The Dietta API enables developers to manage user health activity schedules. Developers can use this API to create, edit, or delete exercise schedules, sleep routines, or other health-related activities. Users of the connected application can view and manage their schedules to maintain consistency and discipline in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
    
5.  Culinary Feature: The Dietta API provides access to information and recommendations for healthy cuisine. Developers can use this API to display nutritionally balanced recipes, nutritional information, or guidance on good eating habits. This allows users of the connected application to gain inspiration in cooking healthy meals and expand their culinary choices.
    
6.  Diary Feature: Through the Dietta API, developers can provide a journal or health record feature to users. Users can record activities, food intake, sleep, or other health information in their personal diary. The Dietta API allows developers to store and access this data, as well as provide recommendations based on the information recorded in the user's diary.
